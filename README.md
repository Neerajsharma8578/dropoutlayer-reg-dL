this repository of code is created to understanding for a dropout layer in deep learning
and why it is used in deep learning?
what we do using dropout layer?

so lets understand----->
dropout layer in deep learning is used in to reduce the overfitting in deep learning overfiting occured when we train our model to large data then prediction on training data is well but it is not predicted well on testing data
so reduced the overfitting we are ued the concept of dropout layer

basic understanding
dropout means when we train our model then we are drop the some nodes while training or testig on data in 1st step and 2nd step we are used those nodes are drop/stop to train the moddel those nodes used in train the model and those previous node are running they are stop them to training
